# About Seedgrow mode
_Seedgrow mode is a mode of MCPYE that is based around the online game **Growtopia**. Unlike Growtopia, this version can be played offline, and is completely open source._
_Seedgrow mode is the 2D mode of MCPYE. Worlds can be converted, but the gameplay is completely different._
_In Seedgrow mode, the game is played mostly through breaking and farming. There is no combat included, except for between other players._
_A method for importing Growtopia worlds will be added in a future update._
