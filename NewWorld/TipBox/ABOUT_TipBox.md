# TipBox
_The tipbox is a dialog box that comes up in between loading parts of the game (such as loading a new/existing world)_
_The tipbox tells you tips about playing the game, and sometimes cracks a joke. It is very helpful for both new and experienced players. Sometimes, it can dictate what you do in your current session._
